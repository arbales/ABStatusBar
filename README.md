# ABStatusBar

It's like the NSStatusBar without all the silly stuff that's been added.

Eventually I may make it easy to make plugins or something but for now I just wanted a status bar that could
show the date, time, week number and Wifi without needing to run Control Center.

I previously used Bartender and Dato to do this, but Apple mushed the status bar stuff into Control Center, which
I don't run.
